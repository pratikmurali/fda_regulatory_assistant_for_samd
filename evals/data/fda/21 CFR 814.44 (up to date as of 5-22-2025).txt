Source: § 814.44 Procedures for review of a PMA.
(a) FDA will begin substantive review of a PMA after the PMA is accepted for filing under§ 814.42. FDA may
refer the PMA to a panel on its own initiative, and will do so upon request of an applicant, unless FDA
determines that the application substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by a panel. If
FDA refers an application to a panel, FDA will forward the PMA, or relevant portions thereof, to each
member of the appropriate FDA panel for review. During the review process, FDA may communicate with
the applicant as set forth under§ 814.37(b), or with a panel to respond to questions that may be posed by
panel members or to provide additional information to the panel. FDA will maintain a record of all
communications with the applicant and with the panel.
(b) The advisory committee shall submit a report to FDA which includes the committee's recommendation
and the basis for such recommendation on the PMA. Before submission of this report, the committee
shall hold a public meeting to review the PMA in accordance with part 14. This meeting may be held by a
telephone conference under§ 14.22(g). The advisory committee report and recommendation may be in
the form of a meeting transcript signed by the chairperson of the committee.
(c) FDA will complete its review of the PMA and the advisory committee report and recommendation and,
within the later of 180 days from the date of filing of the PMA under§ 814.42or the number of days after
the date of filing as determined under§ 814.37(c), issue an approval order underparagraph (d)of this
section, an approvable letter underparagraph (e)of this section, a not approvable letter underparagraph
(f)of this section, or an order denying approval of the application under§ 814.45(a).
(d)
(1) FDA will issue to the applicant an order approving a PMA if none of the reasons in§ 814.45for
denying approval of the application applies. FDA will approve an application on the basis of draft
final labeling if the only deficiencies in the application concern editorial or similar minor deficiencies
in the draft final labeling. Such approval will be conditioned upon the applicant incorporating the
specified labeling changes exactly as directed and upon the applicant submitting to FDA a copy of
the final printed labeling before marketing. FDA will also give the public notice of the order, including
notice of and opportunity for any interested persons to request review under section 515(d)(4) of the
act. The notice of approval will be placed on FDA's home page on the Internet (http://www.fda.gov),
and it will state that a detailed summary of information respecting the safety and effectiveness of
the device, which was the basis for the order approving the PMA, including information about any
adverse effects of the device on health, is available on the Internet and has been placed on public
display, and that copies are available upon request. When a notice of approval is published, data and
information in the PMA file will be available for public disclosure in accordance with§ 814.9.

Procedures for review of a PMA.
(e) (f) (g) (2) A request for copies of the current PMA approvals and denials document and for copies of
summaries of safety and effectiveness shall be sent in writing to the Freedom of Information Staff's
address listed on the Agency's website athttps://www.fda.gov.
FDA will send the applicant an approvable letter if the application substantially meets the requirements of
this part and the agency believes it can approve the application if specific additional information is
submitted or specific conditions are agreed to by the applicant.
(1) The approvable letter will describe the information FDA requires to be provided by the applicant or
the conditions the applicant is required to meet to obtain approval. For example, FDA may require, as
a condition to approval:
(i) The submission of certain information identified in the approvable letter, e.g., final labeling;
(ii) The submission of additional information concerning pediatric uses required by§
814.20(b)(13);
(iii) An FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance
with part 820 and, if applicable, that verifies records pertinent to the PMA;
(iv) Restrictions imposed on the device under section 515(d)(1)(B)(ii) or 520(e) of the act;
(v) Postapproval requirements as described insubpart E of this part.
(2) In response to an approvable letter the applicant may:
(i) Amend the PMA as requested in the approvable letter; or
(ii) Consider the approvable letter to be a denial of approval of the PMA under§ 814.45and
request administrative review under section 515(d)(4) of the act by filing a petition in the form
of a petition for reconsideration under§ 10.33; or
(iii) Withdraw the PMA.
FDA will send the applicant a not approvable letter if the agency believes that the application may not be
approved for one or more of the reasons given in§ 814.45(a). The not approvable letter will describe the
deficiencies in the application, including each applicable ground for denial under section 515(d)(2) (A)-(E)
of the act, and, where practical, will identify measures required to place the PMA in approvable form. In
response to a not approvable letter, the applicant may:
(1) Amend the PMA as requested in the not approvable letter (such an amendment will be considered a
major amendment under§ 814.37(c)(1)); or
(2) Consider the not approvable letter to be a denial of approval of the PMA under§ 814.45and request
administrative review under section 515(d)(4) of the act by filing a petition in the form of a petition
for reconsideration under§ 10.33; or
(3) Withdraw the PMA.
FDA will consider a PMA to have been withdrawn voluntarily if:
(1) The applicant fails to respond in writing to a written request for an amendment within 180 days after
the date FDA issues such request;
(2) The applicant fails to respond in writing to an approvable or not approvable letter within 180 days
after the date FDA issues such letter; or
