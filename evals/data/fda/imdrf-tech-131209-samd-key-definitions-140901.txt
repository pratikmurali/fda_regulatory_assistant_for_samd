and post-market requirements, such as adverse event reporting and notification of 
corrective actions. 
3. ‘Design and/or manufacture’, as referred to in the above definition, may include 
specification development, production, fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, 
repackaging, labelling, relabelling, sterilization, installation, or remanufacturing of 
a medical device; or putting a collection of devices, and possibly other products, 
together for a medical purpose. 
4. Any person who assembles or adapts a medical device that has already been 
supplied by another person for an individual patient, in accordance with the 
instructions for use, is not the manufacturer, provided the assembly or adaptation 
does not change the intended use of the medical device. 
5. Any person who changes the intended use of, or modifies, a medical device without 
acting on behalf of the original manufacturer and who makes it available for use 
under his own name, should be considered the manufacturer of the modified medical 
device. 
6. An authorised representative, distributor or importer who only adds its own address 
and contact details to the medical device or the packaging, without covering or 
changing the existing labelling, is not considered a manufacturer. 
7. To the extent that an accessory is subject to the regulatory requirements of a medical 
device6, the person responsible for the design and/or manufacture of that accessory 
is considered to be a manufacturer. 
5.5 
Intended use / intended purpose 
For SaMD intended use, the definition in GHTF/SG1/N70:2011 “Label and Instructions for Use 
for Medical Devices” applies: 
 
The term “intended use / intended purpose” is the objective intent of the manufacturer regarding 
the use of a product, process or service as reflected in the specifications, instructions and 
information provided by the manufacturer.  
 
5.5.1 Additional considerations for SaMD  
Although not specifically included in the GHTF definition materials such as sales and 
marketing materials may be considered as “information provided by the manufacturer” 
and therefore reflect the objective intent of the manufacturer. Sales and marketing 
materials should be comprehensive and reflect the intended use of the SaMD.
