Subpart A—General
§ 860.1 Scope.
(a) This part implements sections 513, 514(b), 515(b), and 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
with respect to the classification and reclassification of devices intended for human use.
This part prescribes the criteria and procedures to be used by advisory committees, including
classification panels, where applicable, in making their recommendations, and by the Commissioner in
making the Commissioner's determinations regarding the class of regulatory control (class I, class II, or
class III) appropriate for particular devices. Supplementing the general Food and Drug Administration
procedures governing advisory committees (part 14 of this chapter), this part also provides procedures
for manufacturers, importers, and other interested persons to participate in proceedings to classify and
reclassify devices. This part also describes the type of data required for determination of the safety and
effectiveness of a device, and the circumstances under which information submitted to advisory
committees, including classification panels, or to the Commissioner in connection with classification and
reclassification proceedings, will be available to the public.
[43 FR 32993, July 28, 1978, as amended at 86 FR 54846, Oct. 5, 2021]
§ 860.3 Definitions.
For the purposes of this part:
Class means one of the three categories of regulatory control for medical devices, defined as follows:
Class I means the class of devices that are subject only to the general controls authorized by or under sections
501 (adulteration), 502 (misbranding), 510 (registration), 516 (banned devices), 518 (notification and
other remedies), 519 (records and reports), and 520 (general provisions) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act. A device is in class I if:
(1) General controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of
the device, or

21 CFR Part 860 (up to date as of 5/22/2025)
Medical Device Classification Procedures
21 CFR 860.3 “Class I” (2)
(2) There is insufficient information from which to determine that general controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special
controls to provide such assurance, but the device is not life-supporting or life-sustaining, or for a
use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and which does
not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
Class II means the class of devices that is or eventually will be subject to special controls. A device is in class II
if general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness
and there is sufficient information to establish special controls, including the promulgation of
performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of
guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions
in accordance with section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), recommendations, and
other appropriate actions as the Commissioner deems necessary to provide such assurance. For a device
that is purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life, the Commissioner
shall examine and identify the special controls, if any, which are necessary to provide adequate assurance
of safety and effectiveness, and describe how such controls provide such assurance.
Class III means the class of devices for which premarket approval is or will be required in accordance with
section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A device is in class III if insufficient information
exists to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and
effectiveness, or that application of special controls described in the definition of “Class II” in this section
in addition to general controls, would provide such assurance, and if, in addition, the device is life-
supporting or life-sustaining, or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of
human health, or if the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
Classification panel means one of the several advisory committees established by the Commissioner under
section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act andpart 14 of this chapterfor the purpose of
making recommendations to the Commissioner on the classification and reclassification of devices and
for other purposes prescribed by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or by the Commissioner.
Classification regulation means a section underparts 862through892 of this chapterthat contains the
identification (general description and intended use) and classification (class I, II or III) of a single device
type or more than one related device type(s).
Commissioner means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration, United States
Department of Health and Human Services, or the Commissioner's designee.
De Novo request means any submission under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
a medical device, requesting classification into class I or class II, including all information submitted with
or incorporated by reference therein.
FDA means the Food and Drug Administration.
General controls mean the controls authorized by or under sections 501 (adulteration), 502 (misbranding), 510
(registration, listing, and premarket notification), 516 (banned devices), 518 (notification and other
remedies), 519 (records, reports, and unique device identification), and 520 (general provisions) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Generic type of device means a grouping of devices that do not differ significantly in purpose, design, materials,
energy source, function, or any other feature related to safety and effectiveness, and for which similar
regulatory controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

Medical Device Classification Procedures
21 CFR 860.3 “Implant”
Implant means a device that is placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body. A device is
regarded as an implant for the purpose of this part only if it is intended to remain implanted continuously
for a period of 30 days or more, unless the Commissioner determines otherwise to protect human health.
Life-supporting or life-sustaining device means a device that is essential to, or that yields information that is
essential to, the restoration or continuation of a bodily function important to the continuation of human
life.
Petition means a submission seeking reclassification of a device in accordance with§ 860.123.
Special controls mean the controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for a
generic type of device that is class II. Special controls include performance standards, performance
testing, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines
(including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in
accordance with section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), recommendations, and
other appropriate actions, as the Commissioner deems necessary to provide such assurance.
[86 FR 54846, Oct. 5, 2021]
§ 860.5 Confidentiality and use of data and information submitted in connection with
classification and reclassification.
(a) (b) This section governs the availability for public disclosure and the use by the Commissioner of data and
information submitted to classification panels or to the Commissioner in connection with the
classification or reclassification of devices under this part.
In general, data and information submitted to classification panels in connection with the classification of
devices under§ 860.84will be available immediately for public disclosure upon request. However, except
as provided by the special rules inparagraph (c)of this section, this provision does not apply to data and
information exempt from public disclosure in accordance withpart 20 of this chapter: Such data and
information will be available only in accordance with part 20.
(c)
(1) Safety and effectiveness data submitted to classification panels or to the Commissioner in
connection with the classification of a device under§ 860.84, which have not been disclosed
previously to the public, as described in§ 20.81 of this chapter, shall be regarded as confidential if
the device is classified in to class III. Because the classification of a device under§ 860.84may be
ascertained only upon publication of a final regulation, all safety and effectiveness data that have
not been disclosed previously are not available for public disclosure unless and until the device is
classified into class I or II, in which case the procedure inparagraph (c)(2)of this section applies.
(2) Thirty days after publication of a final regulation under§ 860.84classifying a device into class I or
class II, safety and effectiveness data submitted for that device that had been regarded as
confidential underparagraph (c)(1)of this section will be available for public disclosure and placed
on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration
unless, within that 30-day period, the person who submitted the data demonstrates that the data still
fall within the exemption for trade secrets and confidential commercial information described in§
20.61 of this chapter. Safety and effectiveness data submitted for a device that is classified into

class III by regulation in accordance with§ 860.84will remain confidential and unavailable for public
chapter.
disclosure so long as such data have not been disclosed to the public as described in§ 20.81 of this
(3) Because device classification affects generic types of devices, in making determinations under§
860.84concerning the initial classification of a device, the classification panels and the
Commissioner may consider safety and effectiveness data developed for another device in the same
generic type, regardless of whether such data are regarded currently as confidential underparagraph
(c)(1)of this section.
(d)
(1) The fact of its existence and the contents of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with§
860.130or§ 860.132are available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the
(2) Food and Drug Administration.
The fact of the existence of a petition for reclassification filed in accordance with§ 860.134or§
860.136is available for public disclosure at the time the petition is received by the Food and Drug
Administration. The contents of such a petition are not available for public disclosure for the period
of time following its receipt (not longer than 30 days) during which the petition is reviewed for any
deficiencies preventing the Commissioner from making a decision on it. Once it is determined that
the petition contains no deficiencies preventing the Commissioner from making a decision on it, the
petition will be filed with the Dockets Management Staff and its entire contents will be available for
public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the Commissioner in
making a decision on the petition. If, during this 30-day period of time, the petition is found to
contain deficiencies that prevent the Commissioner from making a decision on it, the petitioner will
be so notified and afforded an opportunity to correct the deficiencies.
Thirty days after notice to the petitioner of deficiencies in the petition, the contents of the petition will be
available for public disclosure unless, within that 30 days, the petitioner submits supplemental material
intended to correct the deficiencies in the petition. The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion,
may allow withdrawal of a deficient petition during the 30-day period provided for correcting deficiencies.
Any supplemental material submitted by the petitioner, together with the material in the original petition, is
considered as a new petition. The new petition is reviewed for deficiencies in the same manner as the
original petition, and the same procedures for notification and correction of deficiencies are followed.
Once the petitioner has corrected the deficiencies, the entire contents of the petition will be available for
public disclosure and subject to consideration by classification panels and by the Commissioner in
making a decision on the petition. Deficient petitions which have not been corrected within 180 days after
notification of deficiency will be returned to the petitioner and will not be considered further unless
resubmitted.
(e) The Commissioner may not disclose, or use as the basis for reclassification of a device from class III to
class II, any information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commissioner under section 513, 514,
515, 516, 518, 519, 520(f), 520(g), or 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that falls within the
exemption described in§ 20.61 of this chapterfor trade secrets and confidential commercial information.
The exemption described in§ 20.61does not apply to data or information contained in a petition for
reclassification submitted in accordance with§ 860.130or§ 860.132, or in a petition submitted in
accordance with§ 860.134or§ 860.136that has been determined to contain no deficiencies that prevent
the Commissioner from making a decision on it. Accordingly, all data and information contained in such
petitions may be disclosed by the Commissioner and used as the basis for reclassification of a device
from class III to class II.

Medical Device Classification Procedures
(f) For purposes of this section, safety and effectiveness data include data and results derived from all
studies and tests of a device on animals and humans and from all studies and tests of the device itself
intended to establish or determine its safety and effectiveness.
Confidentiality of data and information in a De Novo file is as follows:
(1) A “De Novo file” includes all data and information from the requester submitted with or incorporated
by reference in the De Novo request, any De Novo supplement, or any other related submission
relevant to the administrative file, as defined in§ 10.3(a) of this chapter. Any record in the De Novo
file will be available for public disclosure in accordance with the provisions of this section andpart
20 of this chapter.
The existence of a De Novo file may not be disclosed by FDA before an order granting the De Novo
request is issued unless it previously has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged by the De Novo
requester.
Before an order granting the De Novo request is issued, data or information contained in the De Novo
file is not available for public disclosure, except to the extent the existence of the De Novo file is
disclosable underparagraph (g)(2)of this section and such data or information has been publicly
disclosed or acknowledged by the De Novo requester.
After FDA issues an order granting a De Novo request, the data and information in the De Novo file
that are not exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act,5 U.S.C. 552, are
immediately available for public disclosure.

§ 860.7 Determination of safety and effectiveness.
(a) The classification panels, in reviewing evidence concerning the safety and effectiveness of a device and in
preparing advice to the Commissioner, and the Commissioner, in making determinations concerning the
safety and effectiveness of a device, will apply the rules in this section.
In determining the safety and effectiveness of a device for purposes of classification, establishment of
special controls for class II devices, and premarket approval of class III devices, the Commissioner and
the classification panels will consider the following, among other relevant factors:
(1) The persons for whose use the device is represented or intended;
(2) The conditions of use for the device, including conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in the labeling or advertising of the device, and other intended conditions of use;
The probable benefit to health from the use of the device weighed against any probable injury or
illness from such use; and
The reliability of the device.
(4) (b) (3) (4) (c)
(1) Although the manufacturer may submit any form of evidence to the Food and Drug Administration in
an attempt to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of a device, the agency relies upon only valid
scientific evidence to determine whether there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and
effective. After considering the nature of the device and the rules in this section, the Commissioner
will determine whether the evidence submitted or otherwise available to the Commissioner is valid
21 CFR 860.7(c)(1) (enhanced display) page 6 of 27
21 CFR Part 860 (up to date as of 5/22/2025)
Medical Device Classification Procedures
21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)
(2) scientific evidence for the purpose of determining the safety or effectiveness of a particular device
and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole, is adequate to support a determination
that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its conditions of use.
Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies,
studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by
qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it
can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary
according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of
warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports,
random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and
unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or
effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device with
questionable safety or effectiveness.
(d)
(1) (2) There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it can be determined, based upon valid
scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health from use of the device for its intended uses
and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use,
outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used to determine the safety of a device
shall adequately demonstrate the absence of unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with
the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use.
Among the types of evidence that may be required, when appropriate, to determine that there is
reasonable assurance that a device is safe are investigations using laboratory animals,
investigations involving human subjects, nonclinical investigations, and analytical studies for in vitro
diagnostic devices.
(e)
(f) (1) (2) There is reasonable assurance that a device is effective when it can be determined, based upon valid
scientific evidence, that in a significant portion of the target population, the use of the device for its
intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions for use and
warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant results.
The valid scientific evidence used to determine the effectiveness of a device shall consist principally
of well-controlled investigations, as defined inparagraph (f)of this section, unless the Commissioner
authorizes reliance upon other valid scientific evidence which the Commissioner has determined is
sufficient evidence from which to determine the effectiveness of a device, even in the absence of
well-controlled investigations. The Commissioner may make such a determination where the
requirement of well-controlled investigations inparagraph (f)of this section is not reasonably
applicable to the device.
The following principles have been developed over a period of years and are recognized by the scientific
community as the essentials of a well-controlled clinical investigation. They provide the basis for the
Commissioner's determination whether there is reasonable assurance that a device is effective based
upon well-controlled investigations and are also useful in assessing the weight to be given to other valid
scientific evidence permitted under this section.

(1) The plan or protocol for the study and the report of the results of a well-controlled investigation shall
include the following:
(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) A clear statement of the objectives of the study;
A method of selection of the subjects that:
(a) Provides adequate assurance that the subjects are suitable for the purposes of the study,
provides diagnostic criteria of the condition to be treated or diagnosed, provides
confirmatory laboratory tests where appropriate and, in the case of a device to prevent a
disease or condition, provides evidence of susceptibility and exposure to the condition
against which prophylaxis is desired;
(b) Assigns the subjects to test groups, if used, in such a way as to minimize any possible
bias;
(c) Assures comparability between test groups and any control groups of pertinent variables
such as sex, severity or duration of the disease, and use of therapy other than the test
device;
An explanation of the methods of observation and recording of results utilized, including the
variables measured, quantitation, assessment of any subject's response, and steps taken to
minimize any possible bias of subjects and observers;
A comparison of the results of treatment or diagnosis with a control in such a fashion as to
permit quantitative evaluation. The precise nature of the control must be specified and an
explanation provided of the methods employed to minimize any possible bias of the observers
and analysts of the data. Level and methods of “blinding,” if appropriate and used, are to be
documented. Generally, four types of comparisons are recognized:
(a) No treatments. Where objective measurements of effectiveness are available and placebo
effect is negligible, comparison of the objective results in comparable groups of treated
and untreated patients;
(b) Placebo control.Where there may be a placebo effect with the use of a device, comparison
of the results of use of the device with an ineffective device used under conditions
designed to resemble the conditions of use under investigation as far as possible;
(c) Active treatment control.Where an effective regimen of therapy may be used for
comparison, e.g., the condition being treated is such that the use of a placebo or the
withholding of treatment would be inappropriate or contrary to the interest of the patient;
(d) Historical control.In certain circumstances, such as those involving diseases with high
and predictable mortality or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or in
the case of prophylaxis where morbidity is predictable, the results of use of the device
may be compared quantitatively with prior experience historically derived from the
adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition in comparable patients
or populations who received no treatment or who followed an established effective
regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic).
A summary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of the data derived from the study,
including any appropriate statistical methods utilized.

(2) To insure the reliability of the results of an investigation, a well-controlled investigation shall involve
the use of a test device that is standardized in its composition or design and performance.
(g)
(1) (2) (3) (4) It is the responsibility of each manufacturer and importer of a device to assure that adequate, valid
scientific evidence exists, and to furnish such evidence to the Food and Drug Administration to
provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses and
conditions of use. The failure of a manufacturer or importer of a device to present to the Food and
Drug Administration adequate, valid scientific evidence showing that there is reasonable assurance
of the safety and effectiveness of the device, if regulated by general controls alone, or by general
controls and special controls, may support a determination that the device be classified into class III.
The Commissioner may require that a manufacturer, importer, or distributor make reports or provide
other information bearing on the classification of a device and indicating whether there is
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or whether it is adulterated or
misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
A requirement for a report or other information under this paragraph will comply with section 519 of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, the requirement will state the reason or
purpose for such request; will describe the required report or information as clearly as possible; will
not be imposed on a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a classified device that has been
exempted from such a requirement in accordance with§ 860.95; will prescribe the time for
compliance with the requirement; and will prescribe the form and manner in which the report or
information is to be provided.
Required information that has been submitted previously to the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, as applicable, need not be resubmitted, but may be incorporated by reference.

§ 860.10 Implants and life-supporting or life-sustaining devices.
A classification panel will recommend classification into class III of any implant or life-supporting or life-
sustaining device unless the panel determines that such classification is not necessary to provide
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. If the panel recommends
classification or reclassification of such a device into a class other than class III, it shall set forth in its
recommendation the reasons for so doing and an identification of the risks to health, if any, presented by
the device. In the case of such a device being recommended for classification or reclassification into
class II, the panel shall describe the special controls that, in addition to general controls, the panel
believes are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device and
how such controls provide such assurance.
The Commissioner will classify an implant or life-supporting or life-sustaining device into class III unless
the Commissioner determines that such classification is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance
of the safety and effectiveness of the device. If the Commissioner proposes to classify or reclassify such
a device into a class other than class III, the regulation or order effecting such classification or
reclassification will be accompanied by a full statement of the reasons for so doing. A statement of the
reasons for not classifying or retaining the device in class III may be in the form of concurrence with the
reasons for the recommendation of the classification panel, together with supporting documentation and

§ 860.15 Exemptions from sections 510, 519, and 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act.
(a) (b) (c) A panel recommendation to the Commissioner that a device be classified or reclassified into class I will
include a recommendation as to whether the device should be exempted from some or all of the
requirements of one or more of the following sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
Section 510 (registration, product listing, and premarket notification), section 519 (records and reports)
and section 520(f) (good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation), and, in
the case of a recommendation for classification into class II, whether the device should be exempted
from the premarket notification requirement under section 510.
A regulation or an order classifying or reclassifying a device into class I will specify which requirements, if
any, of sections 510, 519, and 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act the device is to be
exempted from or, in the case of a regulation or an order classifying or reclassifying a device into class II,
whether the device is to be exempted from the premarket notification requirement under section 510,
together with the reasons for such exemption.
The Commissioner will grant exemptions under this section only if the Commissioner determines that the
requirements from which the device is exempted are not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness of the device.

commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Such a device will be classified by regulation into either
class I (general controls), class II (special controls) or class III (premarket approval), depending upon the
level of regulatory control required to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the
device (§ 860.3(c)). This subpart does not apply to a device that is classified into class III by statute under
section 513(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the Food and Drug Administration
has determined that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to any device subject to this subpart or
under section 520(l)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the device was regarded
previously as a new drug. In classifying apreamendments device to which this section applies, the Food
and Drug Administration will follow the procedures described inparagraphs (b)through(g)of this section.
The Commissioner refers the device to the appropriate classification panel organized and operated in
accordance with section 513 (b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act andpart 14 of this
chapter.

Medical Device Classification Procedures
(c) (d) (e) In order to make recommendations to the Commissioner on the class of regulatory control (class I, class
II, or class III) appropriate for the device, the panel reviews the device for safety and effectiveness. In so
doing, the panel:
(1) Considers the factors set forth in§ 860.7relating to the determination of safety and effectiveness;
(2) Determines the safety and effectiveness of the device on the basis of the types of scientific evidence
set forth in§ 860.7; and
(3) Provides, to the maximum extent practicable, an opportunity for interested persons to submit data
and views on the classification of the device in accordance withpart 14 of this chapter.
Based upon its review of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and applying the
definition of each class in§ 860.3(c), the panel submits to the Commissioner a recommendation
regarding the classification of the device. The recommendation will include:
(1) A summary of the reasons for the recommendation;
(2) A summary of the data upon which the recommendation is based;
(3) An identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by the device;
(4) In the case of a recommendation for classification into class I, a recommendation as to whether the
device should be exempted from the requirements of one or more of the following sections of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Section 510 (registration, product listing, and premarket
notification), section 519 (records and reports), and section 520(f) (good manufacturing practice
requirements of the quality system regulation) and, in the case of a recommendation for
classification into class II, whether the device should be exempted from the premarket notification
requirement under section 510, in accordance with§ 860.15;
(5) In the case of a recommendation for classification into class II or class III, to the extent practicable, a
recommendation for the assignment to the device of a priority for the application of a performance
standard or a premarket approval requirement, and in the case of classification into class II, a
recommendation on the establishment of special controls and whether the device should be
exempted from premarket notification in accordance with§ 860.15; and
(6) In the case of a recommendation for classification of an implant or a life-supporting or life-sustaining
device into class I or class II, a statement of why premarket approval is not necessary to provide
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and an identification of the risks
to health, if any, presented by the device, in accordance with§ 860.10.
A panel recommendation is regarded as preliminary until the Commissioner has reviewed it, discussed it
with the panel if appropriate, and published a proposed regulation classifying the device. Preliminary
panel recommendations are filed at Dockets Management Staff upon receipt and are available to the
public athttps://www.regulations.gov.
(f) (g) The Commissioner publishes the panel's recommendation in theFEDERAL REGISTER,together with a
proposed regulation classifying the device, and other devices of that generic type, and provides interested
persons an opportunity to submit comments on the recommendation and proposed regulation.

Subpart C—Reclassification
§ 860.120 General.
(a) Sections 513(e) and (f), 514(b), 515(b), and 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide for
reclassification of a device and prescribe the procedures to be followed to effect reclassification. The
purposes of subpart C are to:
(1) Set forth the requirements as to form and content of petitions for reclassification;
(2) Describe the circumstances in which each of the five statutory reclassification provisions applies;
and
(3) Explain the procedure for reclassification prescribed in the five statutory reclassification provisions.
The criteria for determining the proper class for a device are set forth in§ 860.3(c). The reclassification of
any device within a generic type of device causes the reclassification of all devices within that generic
type. Accordingly, a petition for the reclassification of a specific device will be considered a petition for
reclassification of all devices within the same generic type.
Any interested person may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(e), 514(b), or 515(b) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A manufacturer or importer may submit a petition for
reclassification under section 513(f) or 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The
