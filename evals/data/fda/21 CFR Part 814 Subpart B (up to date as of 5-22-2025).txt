FDA will identify, in the advisory opinion or correspondence, the type of information that is to be
included in the report or 30-day PMA supplement. If the change is required to be reported to FDA in a
periodic report, the change may be made before it is reported to FDA. If the change is required to be
reported in a 30-day PMA supplement, the change may be made 30 days after FDA files the 30-day
PMA supplement unless FDA requires the PMA holder to provide additional information, informs the
PMA holder that the supplement is not approvable, or disapproves the supplement. The 30-day PMA
supplement shall follow the instructions in the correspondence or advisory opinion. Any 30-day PMA
supplement that does not meet the requirements of the correspondence or advisory opinion will not
be filed and, therefore, will not be deemed approved 30 days after receipt.
(f)
Under section 515(d) of the act, modifications to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture
that affect the safety and effectiveness of a device subject to an approved PMA do not require
submission of a PMA supplement under paragraph (a) of this section and are eligible to be the subject of
a 30-day notice. A 30-day notice shall describe in detail the change, summarize the data or information
supporting the change, and state that the change has been made in accordance with the requirements of
part 820 of this chapter. The manufacturer may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which FDA
receives the 30-day notice, unless FDA notifies the applicant within 30 days from receipt of the notice that
the notice is not adequate. If the notice is not adequate, FDA shall inform the applicant in writing that a
135-day PMA supplement is needed and shall describe what further information or action is required for
acceptance of such change. The number of days under review as a 30-day notice shall be deducted from
the 135-day PMA supplement review period if the notice meets appropriate content requirements for a
PMA supplement.
(g)
The submission and grant of a written request for an exception or alternative under ยง 801.128 or ยง 809.11
of this chapter satisfies the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
