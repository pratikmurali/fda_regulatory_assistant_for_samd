ยง 830.350 Correction of information submitted to the Global Unique Device Identification
Database.
ยง 830.360 Records to be maintained by the labeler.
(a)
If FDA becomes aware that any information submitted to the Global Unique Device Identification Database
(GUDID) appears to be incorrect or potentially misleading, we may notify the labeler of the specific
information that appears to be incorrect, and request that the labeler provide corrected information or
explain why the information is correct. The labeler must provide corrected information or provide a
satisfactory explanation of why the information is correct within 30 days of receipt of FDA's notification.
(b)
If the labeler does not respond to FDA's notification within 30 days of receipt, or if FDA determines, at any
time, that any information in the GUDID is incorrect or could be misleading, we may delete or correct the
information. Any action taken by FDA under this paragraph does not relieve the labeler of its responsibility
under paragraph (a) of this section to provide corrected information or an explanation of why the
information previously submitted is correct.
(a)
Each labeler shall retain, and submit to FDA upon specific request, records showing all unique device
identifiers (UDIs) used to identify devices that must bear a UDI on their label, and the particular version or
model associated with each device identifier. These records must be retained for 3 years from the date
the labeler ceases to market the version or model.
(b)
Compliance with this section does not relieve the labeler of the need to comply with recordkeeping
requirements of any other FDA regulation.
