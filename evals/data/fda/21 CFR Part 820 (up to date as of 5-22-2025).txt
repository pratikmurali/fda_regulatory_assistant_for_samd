Source: Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 820.1 Scope.
(a) Applicability.
(1) Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements are set forth in this quality system
regulation. The requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls
used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all
finished devices intended for human use. The requirements in this part are intended to ensure that
finished devices will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act). This part establishes basic requirements applicable to manufacturers of
finished medical devices. If a manufacturer engages in only some operations subject to the
requirements in this part, and not in others, that manufacturer need only comply with those
requirements applicable to the operations in which it is engaged. With respect to class I devices,
design controls apply only to those devices listed in§ 820.30(a)(2). This regulation does not apply to
manufacturers of components or parts of finished devices, but such manufacturers are encouraged
to use appropriate provisions of this regulation as guidance. Manufacturers of blood and blood
components used for transfusion or for further manufacturing are not subject to this part, but are
subject to subchapter F of this chapter. Manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and
tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), as defined in§ 1271.3(d) of this chapter, that are medical devices
(subject to premarket review or notification, or exempt from notification, under an application
submitted under the device provisions of the act or under a biological product license application
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) are subject to this part and are also subject to
the donor-eligibility procedures set forth in part 1271 subpart C of this chapter and applicable
21 CFR 820.1(a)(1) (enhanced display) page 3 of 20
(2) (3) 21 CFR Part 820 (up to date as of 5/22/2025)
Quality System Regulation (b) (c) (d) 21 CFR 820.1(a)(2)
current good tissue practice procedures in part 1271 subpart D of this chapter. In the event of a
conflict between applicable regulations in part 1271 and in other parts of this chapter, the regulation
specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede the more general.
The provisions of this part shall be applicable to any finished device as defined in this part, intended
for human use, that is manufactured, imported, or offered for import in any State or Territory of the
United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
In this regulation the term “where appropriate” is used several times. When a requirement is qualified
by “where appropriate,” it is deemed to be “appropriate” unless the manufacturer can document
justification otherwise. A requirement is “appropriate” if nonimplementation could reasonably be
expected to result in the product not meeting its specified requirements or the manufacturer not
being able to carry out any necessary corrective action.
The quality system regulation in this part supplements regulations in other parts of this chapter except
where explicitly stated otherwise. In the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in this part and
in other parts of this chapter, the regulations specifically applicable to the device in question shall
supersede any other generally applicable requirements.
Authority.Part 820 is established and issued under authority of sections 501, 502, 510, 513, 514, 515, 518,
519, 520, 522, 701, 704, 801, 803 of the act (21 U.S.C. 351,352,360,360c,360d,360e,360h,360i,360j,
360l,371,374,381,383). The failure to comply with any applicable provision in this part renders a device
adulterated under section 501(h) of the act. Such a device, as well as any person responsible for the
failure to comply, is subject to regulatory action.
Foreign manufacturers.If a manufacturer who offers devices for import into the United States refuses to
permit or allow the completion of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection of the foreign facility
for the purpose of determining compliance with this part, it shall appear for purposes of section 801(a) of
the act, that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture,
packaging, labeling, storage, installation, or servicing of any devices produced at such facility that are
offered for import into the United States do not conform to the requirements of section 520(f) of the act
and this part and that the devices manufactured at that facility are adulterated under section 501(h) of the
act.
(e) Exemptions or variances.
(1) Any person who wishes to petition for an exemption or variance from any device quality system
requirement is subject to the requirements of section 520(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act. Petitions for an exemption or variance shall be submitted according to the procedures
set forth in§ 10.30 of this chapter, the FDA's administrative procedures. For guidance on how to
(2) proceed for a request for a variance, contact Division of Regulatory Programs 2, Office of Regulatory
Programs, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food
and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, Rm. 1438, Silver Spring, MD
20993-0002.
FDA may initiate and grant a variance from any device quality system requirement when the agency
determines that such variance is in the best interest of the public health. Such variance will remain in
effect only so long as there remains a public health need for the device and the device would not
likely be made sufficiently available without the variance.
